Given an integer array of numbers, find a contiguous subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return the product.


Example 1:

    Input: vector<int> nums = {2,3,-2,4}
    Output: 6

    Explanation: {2,3} has the largest product 6.

Example 2:

    Input: vector<int> nums = {-2,0,-1}
    Output: 0

    Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because {-2,-1} is not a subarray.
    
```cpp
    int maxProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
