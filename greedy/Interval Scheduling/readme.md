# Greedy  "Interval Scheduling"

We would like you to implement a greedy algroithm for interval scheduling. An O(nlogn) solution is preferred.

**Hong wants to purchase a house in New Zealand. He went to trademe and jot down the address of the house, the start time and the end time of the open house.**

Hong needs your help and visit **as many houses as possible**

We use # for the comments and we have e.g. n = 5 to indicate the the number of jobs.  

Hong wrote in the order of the address, a colon, and the start time and the end time.  There is a whitespace after the colon and between each integer of the start time and end time. **For example, 1 East Coast Rd: 2 4**



You should output each address Hong will be visiting in the exact order. In case of a draw, you pick the one that you read first from Hong's notes.


# Sample Input:
\# Yo supï¼Ÿ

\# I am POOOOOR

n = 5

\# GIMEEEEE MONEY

1 East Coast Rd: 2 4

2 West Coast Rd: 5 7

3 North Coast Rd: 8 10

4 South Coast Rd: 11 13

1 Too Expensive Rd: 0  19



# Sample output

1 East Coast Rd

2 West Coast Rd

3 North Coast Rd

4 South Coast Rd
